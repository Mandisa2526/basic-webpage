                     <p>The southernmost tip of Africa,Cape Town is one of the most magnificent parts of the world, a paradise full of exquisite scenery, beautiful beaches, two oceans the icy Atlantic and the warmer Indian Ocean and a wide variety of attractions to make any holiday-maker happy. I cannot wait to experience swimming with the penguines at Boulders beach, rock climbing the Lion's Head and watching the sunset in Signalhill and also not excluding the Champmans peak drive.</p>

Located on an old gold mine which closed in 1971,[1] the park is themed around the gold rush that started in 1886 on the Witwatersrand, the buildings on the park are designed to mimic the same period. There is a museum dedicated to gold mining on the grounds where it is possible to see a gold-containing ore vein and see how gold is poured into barrels. And multiple shops around the park can be located.</p>
