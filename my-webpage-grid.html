                            is an amusement park in Johannesburg, South Africa. Located on an old gold mine which closed in 1971,[1] the park is themed around the gold rush that started in 1886 on the Witwatersrand, the buildings on the park are designed to mimic the same period. There is a museum dedicated to gold mining on the grounds where it is possible to see a gold-containing ore vein and see how gold is poured into barrels. And multiple shops around the park can be located.

                            Victoria Yards was not always a home for creative minds, learners and entrepreneurs.  Purpose built as a steam laundry in the 1913, the property, now nearly 100 years old, has changed little in the way of the original buildings, standing derelict for a while before being occupied by informal traders.
